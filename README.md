# toilet-paper-app

## Project structure

* This is a react app built with the create-react-app scaffolding
  * Using react-router for navigation ([docs](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start))
* Using bootstrap (with the react-bootsrap package) basic css styling
  * For UI changes, use [these docs](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/components/alerts) for components etc that bootstrap give out of the box
* Integration with google maps and google sheets as database (sheets to be built out)

## Usage

The app requires Node.js to be installed locally. Once you have Node, run the following from the project directory. This would setup the local dev server on http://localhost:3000.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Strictly optional: setup Prettier in your editor for code formatting.

## Deployments

We have continuous deployment on every push to `master` with a Netlify integration. Give a minute or two for the changes to deploy after a push.

The app is deployed at https://peaceful-rosalind-47c3e2.netlify.com

## Contribute

Let's push directly to master for now, and use the group chat / issues for coordination.
